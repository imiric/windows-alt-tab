Windows Alt Tab (A GNOME Shell extension)
=========================================

A replacement for Alt-Tab, allows to cycle between windows of the current workspace.

The main differences from the builtin Alt-Tab are:

- It removes the group handling, so Alt-Tab switches between windows of the same
  application, instead of having to press Alt-`. This mimics the default behavior
  of other window managers.
- It (optionally) adds live window previews!
- It has a "Bring To Front" feature where windows are displayed in the background
  while Alt-Tab is active.


Installation

You can download and enable the extension from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/38/windows-alt-tab/.
